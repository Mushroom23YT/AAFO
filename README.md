UPDATE: FULL GAME IS ON GAMEJOLT LETS GO
# AAFO
The full Alpha and f**king omega game!
This is where the full game and the coming dlc will be
released. The reason I'm putting it on GitHub
instead of gamejolt is because I want the game
to be open source for mods. Also, this is the
official game. The one on gamejolt by EspeonGaming
is me, but it's a old deprecated build. It is also
on GitHub for archival purposes. If you want to mod
the game, read below or else, have fun!
MODDING TERMS:
If you mod this game and publish it, you must
credit me and link the game where you post it.
That's about all I want though.
To mod the game you need these programs:
RPG Maker VX Ace
To mod it, open the Game.rvproj2 file
and the game will open.
PLEASE DONT MOD THE GAME UNTIL THE 1.0 UPDATE
You are free to change most assets and music.
However you must keep Humphrey, Kate, Lilly,
and their assets in the game. They can go unused just keep them.
The voice for the main characters are,
Humphrey: ScanSoft Daniel
Kate: Microsoft Hazel(new version)
Lilly: IVONA Ivy
Anyway, more will be written when the V1.0 Update releases.
Also, if you want the original game source,
download whatever is the latest release.
The source code here will be the mod template.
NO source will be uploaded yet!
